    intent: [
        'The intent is to be deliberately thoughtful in the way that we derive meaning, separating signal from noise, in the face of an increasingly VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) world.  Sense making acknowledges biases in the processing and communication of information due to our limited cognitive capacities as well as the growing impact of our individual decisions.  The intent is to elevate our thinking to fastidiously pursue the truth in ever murky waters so that people in our organisations have better access to more accurate information flows.'
