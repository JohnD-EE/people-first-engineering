    overview: [
        'FLOW is living your genius.  It is that state of mind as an Engineer when you are stretched just slightly beyond your skill levels, deeply immersed in an interesting problem, hours fly past, you feel \'in the zone\' enjoying bouts of uninterrupted time where you are fully tapping in to your creativity.  FLOW is a deeply satisfying state of focused concentration and inner clarity where you feel a temporary loss of ego, an optimal state of ecstacy where you feel at one with the surrounding world, experiencing a cascade of insights. The more you FLOW, the more you are training your capacity for insight with your mind becoming more capable of deep causal pattern recognition. FLOW is an optimal state of consciousness. Flow is described by Steven Kotler as "a peak state where we both feel our best and perform our best. It is a transformation available to anyone, anywhere, provided that certain initial conditions are met. FLOW as Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi described it is engagement with everyday life.'

                'Engineers SHOULD strive to develop an autotelic character, engaging in tasks for their own sake, where work is not indulged in for the sake of short-term stimulation and gratification, but in the pursuit of long-term lifetime expression of intrinsic Mastery, Autonomy and Connectedness. There are no wasted experiences.',
                'Engineers MAY strive to make even the dullest moments interesting, experience the \'Zen of washing dishes\', trying to be present and in the moment, attend to one\'s thoughts and emotions, creatively striving for excellence on the most boring of tasks.',
                'Engineers MAY adopt private practices to enhance self-awareness or the peak experience of FLOW. Such practices may include meditation, mindfulness, or dedicated pursuits in sports or the arts which develop attitudes and \'Attention to Awareness\' skills transferable to the Engineering domain.'
